# Welcom to Bio-Ex!

Bio-Ex is an effort I started to bring some basic tooling and support for
computational biology/bioinformatics to Elixir. Or rather, to bring Elixir to
them!

I hope to build out several example tools, as well as integrations with other
systems that can help people leverage the power of Elixir to do biology!

## Why Elixir?

The [Nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx) project says this well:

> The goal of the Nx project is to marry the power of numerical computing with the
> Erlang VM capabilities for building concurrent, scalable, and fault-tolerant systems.

Just replace numerical computing with computational biology, and you're pretty
much on track to get my gist.

I'm hoping that this can serve as a front-end and supportive set of tools for
leveraging the power of projects like Nx.
